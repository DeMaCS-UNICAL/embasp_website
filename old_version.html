            <div> EmbASP is a general framework for embedding Answer Set Programming (ASP) in complex systems, and in particular within applications for mobile devices. EmbASP is conceived in order to help developers at designing and implementing complex reasoning tasks in a straightforward way by means of ASP solvers. The framework is provided with <a href="http://www.dlvsystem.com/" target="_blank">DLV</a> as default solver, which is the first ASP system which is undergoing an industrial exploitation; however, it is easy to extend it with different solvers through plain Java Object-Oriented programming. </div>

                                        app that monitors the user activity during the day and suggests some workout plans
                                        that depend on her age, weight, gender and goals. The app periodically stores some
                                        information about the user activities (running, walking, etc.) and infers the current
                                        amount of calories burned so far. When the user asks for a workout plan, <em>DLVfit</em>                                        proposes a set of exercises that would allow the user to reach her daily goal, taking
                                        into account also to her preferences. The suggested workout plans are computed in
                                        the background by DLV via EmbASP. </p>

                                    <p>The ASP program used within <em>DLVfit</em> can be found in the repository. Basically,
                                        the program guesses for possible fitness exercises to do in order to burn the remaing
                                        calories. Each answer set represent a possible workout plan, in which is ensured
                                        that the user's requirements about the calories to burn and the time to spend in
                                        the workout are respected. Moreover, also user's preferences are taken into account
                                        by means of weak constraints.</p>

                                        by proposing a series of educational games, and developing a personalized educational
                                        path. The games are divided into four macro-areas: Logic, Numeric-Mathematical, Memory,
                                        and Verbal Language. The usage of ASP allows the application to adapt to the game

In particular we show how to use the framework to develop a simple mobile app that make use of ASP in order to solve the 3-Colouring problem. This problem asks for a valid assignment of colours to the nodes of a graph: given a graph as set of nodes and edges between them, it is "3-colourable" if to each node can be assigned one among three available colours, in such a way that any two nodes directly linked by an edge cannot have the same colour.</p>

                        <p>The framework can be invoked adding logic programs as strings and as files:</p>
                        <pre><code class="language-java">
        ASPHandler handler = new DLVHandler();
        handler.addRawInput("col(N,red) | col(N,green) | col(N,blue) :- node(N).");
        handler.addRawInput(":- col(N1,C1), col(N2,C1), edge(N1,N2).");
        handler.addFileInput("my_edb_file.asp");
        handler.setFilter("col");
        handler.start(theContext, myAnswerSetCallback);
                        </code></pre>
                        <p>First, we create a new instance of an ASPHandler subclass. Then, the program is added as string input, while "my_edb_file.asp" is a file of input facts, added by its path. In addition, a filter option is set on the predicate "col".
                        </p>
                        <p>Finally, we start the execution of the solver giving as parameter the Android Context (needed to start the Service) and an object which must be an instance of a class implementing AnswerSetCallback. </p>
                        <p>The framework allows also to add input using objects:</p>
                        <pre><code class="language-java">
        Edge edge1 = new Edge("node_1","node_2");
        Edge edge2 = new Edge("node_1","node_3");
        handler.addInput(edge1);
        handler.addInput(edge2);
                        </code></pre>
                        <p>In order to use this feature, the added objects' classes must be implemented as JavaBeans and properly annotated. Basically, the class Edge can be annotated in this way
                            <!-- (more details about the format of the annotations can be found <a href="">here. TODO </a>)!-->:</p>

                        <p>Once the solver has been started with the given input, the framework offers different ways to gather its result. First, the user has to write a class implementing AnswerSetCallback, and override the abstract method <code>callback(AnswerSets answerSets)</code>. The answer sets found by the solver are contained in an AnswerSets object and one can use this object to analyse each AnswerSet returned by the reasoner. Moreover the user can get an <code>AnswerSet</code> as set of objects, previously annotated using the specific annotations.</p>
                        <pre><code class="language-java">
            public void callback(AnswerSets answerSets) {
                List&lt;AnswerSet&gt; answerSetList=answerSets.getAnswerSetsList();

                    ....
                }
            }
                        </code></pre>
                        <p>In our example of 3-colouring, in order to get back the colours assignment in the form of objects, one can implement a class representing the "col" predicate. In this case, this class will be used to convert the "col" facts in the answer sets as instances of this class; this class can be implemented as follows:</p>
                        <pre><code class="language-java">
        @Predicate("col")
        public class Col {
        @Term(0)
        private String node;
        @Term(1)
        private String colour;
        .....
        }
                        </code></pre> In order to notify the framework of the existence of the Col class, the user has to register it, calling the <code>registerClass(Class&lt;?&gt; cl)</code> method of the Singleton class ASPMapper, that notify this class to the ASPMapper. The registration is automatic if the input or the fillter are added using Class objects. The framework in a transparent way will map the answer sets into objects taking care of the parsing of the output string returned by the solver. From this point on, the user can manage the answer sets using plain Java objects as she wish.

                                <p>The figure shows how the layers interact. It is worth noting that, as for the implementation herein presented, <code class="layer">ASPHandler</code> and <code class="layer">Solver Handler</code> are totally written in Java, and communicate by means of function calls; in addition, even if the framework can be easily extended in order to handle other ASP solvers, it comes equipped with <a href="http://www.dlvsystem.com/" target="_blank">DLV</a> as default <code class="layer">ASP Solver</code> layer. Given that <a href="http://www.dlvsystem.com/" target="_blank">DLV</a> is implemented in C++, the <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/jni">JNI</a> was used in order to let the upper layers communicate with the <code class="layer">ASP Solver</code> layer. Basically, the execution works as follows: <code class="layer">ASPHandler</code> (asynchronously) calls the <code class="layer">Solver Handler</code>, providing it with the logic program and the proper options for the solver; then, <code class="layer">Solver Handler</code> starts the <code class="layer">ASP Solver</code>, invoking the native functions of the solver with the needed parameters, and then collecting the reasoning results. Eventually, it publishes the results collected by <code class="layer">ASPHandler</code> and turn them back to the user via a callback function; this mechanism is better detailed below. The <code class="layer">Solver Handler</code> layer is needed in order to handle an Android Service, i.e., a native application component that can perform long-running operations in the background; this allows the application that makes use of <code>EmbASP</code> can asynchronously perform other operations while waiting for the answer from the ASP solver. Furthermore, the use of an Android Service makes the solver type and invocation details transparent to the framework. It is noteworthy that the stratified architecture has been designed in order to be general enough to facilitate the replacement of the <code class="layer">ASP Solver</code> layer. Moreover, it can be adapted, with minor changes, to any other Java compliant environment, even much different from Android.</p>

                        <p>The framework is composed by an hierarchy of classes that interact as shown in the figure.</p>

                        <div class="row">
                            <figure class="col-xs-12 col-sm-offset-1 col-sm-10 text-center">

                        </div>

                        <p>The abstract class <code class="class">ASPHandler</code> contains the methods to add input in different ways; in particular, the input can be in the form of simple string, files or Java Objects. It contains also a method to set options for the solver. Since the filter option is a very common one, the framework provides a direct way to add it. Indeed, as for the input, the user can set a filter as string using the predicates names, or as a class object representing classes that are annotated as explained hereafter. In addiction, since it acts like an interface to the users, it also contains the method to let the solver starts the reasoning, so this is the class that has to be extended in order to use the framework with an other solver. However, it comes already equipped with an implementation of this class, that uses <a href="http://www.dlvsystem.com/" target="_blank">DLV</a> as solver, the <code>DLVHandler</code> class. In addition, each concrete class that extends <code class="class">ASPHandler</code> should start a proper <code class="class">ASPService</code>.</p>

                        The abstract class <code class="class">ASPService</code> manages the invocation of the solver and takes care of the results of its computation. The framework provides a concrete implementation of this class, <a>DLVService</a>, which invokes the <a href="http://www.dlvsystem.com/" target="_blank">DLV</a> solver. The source code of <a href="http://www.dlvsystem.com/" target="_blank">DLV</a> has been built using the Android <a href="https://developer.android.com/tools/sdk/ndk/index.html">NDK</a> and the <a href="http://www.dlvsystem.com/" target="_blank">DLV</a> code has been optimized for this particular use case, and is linked to the Java code using the <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/jni">JNI</a> as required by the <a href="https://developer.android.com/tools/sdk/ndk/index.html">NDK</a>. The following figure depicts an abstract class diagram of an implementation of EmbASP enhanced with two generic solvers.

                        <p>In order to get back the results obtained by the solver, that is invoked asynchronously, it is needed a callback function, which is automatically called when the computation is terminated. This callback function can be specified implementing the <code>AnswerSetCallback</code> interface.</p>
                        <p>The answer sets are represented by the class <code>AnswerSets</code> that can be extended in order to parse the specific output of different ASP solvers. While, the concept of answer set is captured by the <code>AnswerSet</code> class.</p>

                        <p>The framework provides also a <code>mapper</code> able to convert the output string of the solver into Java Objects. This conversion is guided by the annotations of the Java Objects mapped. Indeed, to exploit this functionality, the user has to provides classes with specific annotations and those classes must be implemented as JavaBeans. Basically, there are two types of annotations:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li> <code>@Predicate(String name)</code> specify the predicate name and the target of this annotation must be a class.</li>
                            <li> <code>@Term(Integer position)</code> specify the term position in the atoms (whose predicate name is specified with <code>@Predicate</code> annotation) and the target of this annotation must be a field of a class.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>Moreover, the mapping is done also in the other way around, from objects to strings, so that the input can be also specified as plain Java objects.</p>
