            <div> EmbASP is a framework for the integration of Answer Set Programming in external systems for generic applications,
            	conceived in order to help developers at designing and implementing complex reasoning tasks by means of ASP solvers on different platforms.
				The framework is provided with APIs for the use of two state-of-the-art ASP systems, namely DLV and clingo, respectively,
				on Android mobile context and on desktop platform; however, it has been designed to be easily extensible and adaptable to different solvers and platforms.

                                        app that monitors the user activity during the day and suggests some workout plans
                                        that depend on her age, weight, gender and goals. The app periodically stores some
                                        information about the user activities (running, walking, etc.) and infers the current
                                        amount of calories burned so far. When the user asks for a workout plan, <em>DLVfit</em>                                        proposes a set of exercises that would allow the user to reach her daily goal, taking
                                        into account also to her preferences. The suggested workout plans are computed in
                                        the background by DLV via EmbASP. </p>

                                    <p>The ASP program used within <em>DLVfit</em> can be found in the repository. Basically,
                                        the program guesses for possible fitness exercises to do in order to burn the remaing
                                        calories. Each answer set represent a possible workout plan, in which is ensured
                                        that the user's requirements about the calories to burn and the time to spend in
                                        the workout are respected. Moreover, also user's preferences are taken into account
                                        by means of weak constraints.</p>

                                        by proposing a series of educational games, and developing a personalized educational
                                        path. The games are divided into four macro-areas: Logic, Numeric-Mathematical, Memory,
                                        and Verbal Language. The usage of ASP allows the application to adapt to the game
                                        experiences fulfilled by the user, her formative gap, and the obtained improvements.

                                        The application continuously profiles the user by recording mistakes and successes, and dynamically builds and updates a
                                        customized educational path along the different games. The application features a
                                        "Parent Area", that allows parents to monitor child's achievements and to express
                                        some preferences, such as explicit filters of some games or educational areas.

                In the following, we detail the actual usage of the framework by means of a running example; 
                as a use case, we will develop a simple Android application for solving Sudoku puzzles.
               	Hereafter, we explain the crucial stepts, while <b>the complete code is freely available <a href="https://github.com/dave90/EmbASPSudokuExample">here</a></b>.             
                </div>
                </p>
                <div>
                The framework features a annotation-guided mapping, offered by the <i>ASPMapper</i> component, for two-way translations between strings recognizable by ASP solvers 
                and objects in the programming language at hand, directly employable within applications. 
                By means of this feature, the ASP-based aspects can be separated from the Java coding: 
                the programmer doesn't even necessarily need to be aware of ASP. 
                </div>
                <div>
                Indeed, we can assume the user has designed (or has been given) a proper logic program <i>P</i> 
                to solve a Sudoku puzzle and a set of facts <i>F</i> representing the initial schema, 
                such that the answer set of <i>P+F</i> correspond to the only admissible solution.
                We assume the typical setting in which partially filled Sudoku tables are chosen in a way such that the complete puzzle solution exists and is unique; 
                a possible ASP program is embedded in the complete example (<a href="https://github.com/dave90/EmbASPSudokuExample">here</a>).
                
                </div>
                <div>
                Intuitively, we represent a sudoku puzzle as a matrix of integers such that position (i,j) contains the value of cell (i,j) in the initial schema; 
                cells initially empty are represented by positions containing zero.

				To actually implement the app, we need at first to create an <i>InputProgram</i> instance and an <i>AndroidHandler</i> instance as shown in the following snippet of Java code.</div>
                <pre><code class="language-java">
	InputProgram inputProgram = new InputProgram();
	for(int i = 0; i < 9; i++)
		for(int j = 0; j < 9; j++)
			if(matrix[i][j]!=0)
				inputProgram.addObjectInput(new Cell(i,j,matrix[i][j]));
					
	Handler handler = new AndroidHandler(context,DLVAndroidService.class);
	handler.addProgram(inputProgram);            
                </code></pre>
                <div>
                The <i>InputProgram</i> instance is filled by means of Java objects representing the initial state of the schema: 
                in particular, instances of a proper class <i>Cell</i>; 
                the <i>AndroidHandler</i> creation requires as parameters the Android Context (an Android utility, needed to start an Android Service) and the type of <i>AndroidService</i> to use.
				</div>
				<div>
				The <i>Cell</i> objects created above can be translated by the <i>ASPMapper</i> into strings properly recognizable from the ASP solver as logic facts of the form <i>cell(X,Y,Value)</i>, 
				that appear in the logic program. To this purpose, the class <i>Cell</i> should be annotated as following:
                </div>
				<pre><code class="language-java">
	@Predicate("cell")
	public class Cell {
		
		@Term(1)
		int row;
		
		@Term(2)
		int column;
		
		@Term(3)
		int value;
	
		...
		
	}
            </code></pre>
                       
            <div>
            It's worth noting that Annotations constitute the key feature of the process. In order to map a class to a predicate, and hence objects to logic literals, two annotations are adopted:
			<ul>
				<li>
				    <i>@Predicate(string_name)</i>: the target must be a class, and defines the predicate name the class is mapped to;
				</li>
				<li>
				    <i>@Term (integer_position)</i>: the target must be a field of a class annotated via @Predicate, and defines the term (and its position) in the ASP atom the field is mapped to.
				</li>
			</ul>
			</div>
			<div>
			Then, the encoding has to be provided to the handler. For example, it can be loaded it as a text file from a <a href="https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/resources/index.html">Resources folder</a>, which is typically meant at containing images, sound, and files in general, within Android applications.
			At this point, the reasoning process can be started, and since for Android we provide only the asynchronous execution mode, a callback object is in charge of fetching the output when the ASP system has done.
			</div>
			<pre><code class="language-java">
	String sudokuEncoding = getEncodingFromResources();
	handler.addProgram(new InputProgram(sudokuEncoding));
	Callback callback = new MyCallback();
	handler.startAsync(callback);
			</code></pre> 

			<div>Finally, once the computation is over, from within the callback function the output can be retrieved directly in form of Java objects:</div>

			<pre><code class="language-java">
	AnswerSet as = answerSets.getAnswersets().get(0);
	for(Object obj: as.getAtoms()) {
		Cell cell = (Cell) obj;
		matrix[cell.getRow()][cell.getColumn()] = cell.getValue();
	}
		</code></pre>
                        
                </div>
            </div>
        </div>
