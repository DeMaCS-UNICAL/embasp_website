            <div> EmbASP is a framework for the integration (embedding) of Answer Set 
			Programming (ASP) in external systems for generic applications. It helps 
			developers at designing and implementing complex reasoning tasks by means 
			of ASP solvers on different platforms. 
			The framework can be implemented in a object-oriented programming language
			of choice, easing and guiding the generation of suitable libraries for the 
			use of specific solvers on particular platforms.

			We currently provide ready-made libraries for the use of two 
			state-of-the-art ASP systems: DLV and clingo, on Android mobile context 
			and on desktop platform, respectively; however, it has been designed to be easily extensible and adaptable to different solvers and platforms.

                                        app that monitors the user activity during the day and suggests some workout plans
                                        that depend on her age, weight, gender and goals. The app periodically stores some
                                        information about the user activities (running, walking, etc.) and infers the current
                                        amount of calories burned so far. When the user asks for a workout plan, <em>DLVfit</em>
                                        proposes a set of exercises that would allow the user to reach her daily goal, taking
                                        into account also to her preferences. The suggested workout plans are computed in
                                        the background by DLV via EmbASP. </p>

                                    <p>The ASP program used within <em>DLVfit</em> can be found in the repository. Basically,
                                        the program guesses for possible fitness exercises to do in order to burn the remaing
                                        calories. Each answer set represent a possible workout plan, in which is ensured
                                        that the user's requirements about the calories to burn and the time to spend in
                                        the workout are respected. Moreover, also user's preferences are taken into account
                                        by means of weak constraints.</p>

                                        of ASP. In particular, it is able to guide the child throughout the learning tasks,
                                        by proposing a series of educational games, and developing a personalized educational
                                        path. The games are divided into four macro-areas: Logic, Numeric-Mathematical, Memory,
                                        and Verbal Language. The usage of ASP allows the application to adapt to the game
                                        experiences fulfilled by the user, her formative gap, and the obtained improvements.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        The application continuously profiles the user by recording mistakes and successes, and dynamically builds and updates a
                                        customized educational path along the different games. The application features a
                                        "Parent Area", that allows parents to monitor child's achievements and to express
                                        some preferences, such as explicit filters of some games or educational areas.

					<div class="panel-body">
                                        <div>In the following, we describe an the actual usage of the framework by means of a running example; as a use case, we will develop
                    a simple Android application for solving Sudoku puzzles. Hereafter, we explain the crucial stepts, while
                    <b>the complete code is freely available <a href="https://github.com/dave90/EmbASPSudokuExample">here</a></b>.
                </div>
                <div>
                    The framework features a annotation-guided mapping, offered by the <i>ASPMapper</i> component, for two-way
                    translations between strings recognizable by ASP solvers and objects in the programming language at hand,
                    directly employable within applications. By means of this feature, the ASP-based aspects can be separated
                    from the Java coding: the programmer doesn't even necessarily need to be aware of ASP.
                </div>
                <div>                   
                Let us think of a user that designed (or has been given) a proper logic program <i>P</i> to solve a sudoku puzzle and has also an initial schema. We assume that the initial schema is well-formed i.e. the complete schema solution exists and is unique. A possible program <i>P</i> is embedded in the complete example (<a href="https://github.com/dave90/EmbASPSudokuExample">here</a>), that, coupled with a set of facts <i>F</i> representing the given initial schema, allows to obtain the only admissible solution.
                </div>
                <div>
				By means of the annotation-guided mapping, the initial schema can be expressed in forms of Java objects. To this extent, we define the class <i>Cell</i>, aimed at representing the single cell of the sudoku schema, as follows:
                </div>
                <pre><code class="language-java">
    @Predicate("cell")
    public class Cell {
    
        @Term(1)
        private int row;
        
        @Term(2)
        private int column;
        
        @Term(3)
        private int value;
        
        [...]
        
    }           
                </code></pre>
                <div>
				It is worth noticing how the class has been annotated by two custom annotations, defined according to the following syntax:
					<ul>
                        <li>
                            <i>@Predicate(string_name)</i>: the target must be a class, and defines the predicate name the
                            class is mapped to;
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <i>@Term(integer_position)</i>: the target must be a field of a class annotated via @Predicate,
                            and defines the term (and its position) in the ASP atom the field is mapped to.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
Thanks to these annotations the <i>ASPMapper</i> class will be able to map <i>Cell</i> objects into strings properly recognizable from the ASP solver as logic facts of the form <i>cell(Row,Column,Value)</i>. At this point, we can create an <a href="https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/Activity.html">Android Activity Component</a>, and start deploying our sudoku application:
                </div>
                <pre><code class="language-java">
    public class MainActivity extends AppCompatActivity {
	
        [...]
        private Handler handler;
    
        @Override
        protected void onCreate(Bundle bundle) {
            handler = new AndroidHandler(getApplicationContext(), DLVAndroidService.class);
            [...]
        }
        
        public void onClick(final View view){
            startReasoning();
            [...]
        }
    
        public void startReasoning() {
            InputProgram inputProgram = new InputProgram();
            for (int i = 0; i < 9; i++){
                for (int j = 0; j < 9; j++)
                    try {
                        if(sudokuMatrix[i][j]!=0) {
                            inputProgram.addObjectInput(new Cell(i, j, sudokuMatrix[i][j]));
                        }
                    } catch (Exception e) {	
                    	// Handle Exception 
                    }
            }
            handler.addProgram(inputProgram);
    
            String sudokuEncoding = getEncodingFromResources();			
            handler.addProgram(new InputProgram(sudokuEncoding));
    
            Callback callback = new MyCallback();
            handler.startAsync(callback);
        }
    }
            </code></pre>

                <div>
                   The class contains an <i>Handler</i> instance as field, that is initialized when the <i>Activity</i> is created as an <i>AndroidHandler</i>.
Required parameters include the <i>Android Context</i> (an Android utility, needed to start an Android Service Component) and the type of <i>AndroidService</i> to use, in our case a <i>DLVAndroidService</i>.
                </div>
                <div>
                    In addiction, in order to represent an initial sudoku schema, the class features a matrix of integers as another field where position <i> (i,j) </i> contains the value of cell <i> (i,j) </i> in the initial schema; cells initially empty are represented by positions containing zero.
                </div>
                <div>
                The method <i>startReasoning</i> is in charge of actually managing the reasoning: in our case, it is invoked in response to a click event that is generated when the user asks for the solution.
It is firstly created an <i>InputProgram</i> object that is filled with <i>Cell</i> objects representing the initial schema, which is then provided to the handler; then it is provided with the sudoku encoding.
It could be loaded, for instance, by means of an utility function that retrieves it from the <a href="http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/resources">Android Resources folder</a>, which, within Android applications, is typically meant for containing images, sounds, files and resources in general.              
                </div>
                <div>
                At this point, the reasoning process can start; since for Android we provide only the asynchronous execution mode, a callback object is in charge of fetching the output when the ASP system has done.
                </div>
                <div>
                Finally, once the computation is over, from within the callback function the output can be retrieved directly in form of Java objects. For instance, in our case an inner class <i>MyCallback</i> implements the interface <i>Callback</i>:</div>
                <pre><code class="language-java">
    private class MyCallback implements Callback {

        @Override
        public void callback(Output o) {
            if(!(o instanceof AnswerSets))
                return;
            AnswerSets answerSets=(AnswerSets)o;
            if(answerSets.getAnswersets().isEmpty())
                return;
            AnswerSet as = answerSets.getAnswersets().get(0);
            try {
                for(Object obj:as.getAtoms()) {
                    Cell cell = (Cell) obj;
                    sudokuMatrix[cell.getRow()][cell.getColumn()] = cell.getValue();
                }
            } catch (Exception e) {
                // Handle Exception
            }
            displaySolution();
        }
    }

							Handlers ,in addition, provides two methods for starting a solver
							:
							<code class="class">startSync</code>
							and
							<code class="class">startAsync</code>
							for a detailed description refer to <a href="#documentation">JavaDoc</a>.
						</div>
						How data is formatted and transmitted from handler to solver , in
						order to start a reasoning process , is handled by classes that
						implements
						<code class="class"> Service</code>
						interface. The framework provides two classes that provide
						facilities to make easier the integration of ASP in complex
						systems the
						<code class="class">AndroidService</code>
						and
						<code class="class">DesktopService</code>
						though many more classes can be easily generated.
						<div>
							Starting a reasoning process depends entirely from the
							implementation of the subclasses a default reasoner for DLV in
							Android systems is the
							<code calass="class">DLVAndroidService</code>
							that is written in C++ , has been built using the Android NDK and
							the <a href="http://www.dlvsystem.com/" target="_blank">DLV</a> code has been optimized for this particular use case, and
							is linked to the Java code using the JNI as required by the NDK.
						</div>
						<div>
							In order to get back results obtainer by the solver ,that is
							invoked asynchronously,it is needed a callback function wich is
							automatically called when computation is terminated.This callback
							function can be specified implementing the
							<code class="class">Callback</code>
							interface.
							<code class="class">Output</code>
							represent a simple output in a string format and is used as
							anchor for
							<code class="class">AnswerSets</code>
							class. AnswerSets can be extended in order to parse specific
							output of different ASP solvers, the framework provide two
							AnswerSets one for DLV
							<code class="class">DLVAnswerSets</code>
							and one for Clingo
							<code class="class">ClingoAnswerSets</code>
							.
						</div>


						<div>
							<code class="class">ASPMapper</code>
							class is in charge of translating data from objects into ASP
							programs (generally as strings) , when an object is given as
							input, the mapper is able to convert only if specific annotations
							are provided. Moreover, the mapping is done also in the other way around, from
							objects to strings, so that the input can be also specified as
							plain Java objects.
