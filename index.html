            <div> EmbASP is a general framework for embedding Answer Set Programming (ASP) in complex systems, and in particular
                within applications for mobile devices. EmbASP is conceived in order to help developers at designing and
                implementing complex reasoning tasks in a straightforward way by means of ASP solvers. The framework is provided
                with <a href="http://www.dlvsystem.com/" target="_blank">DLV</a> as default solver, which is the first ASP
                system which is undergoing an industrial exploitation; however, it is easy to extend it with different solvers
                through plain Java Object-Oriented programming. </div>

                                        app that monitors the user activity during the day and suggests some workout plans
                                        that depend on her age, weight, gender and goals. The app periodically stores some
                                        information about the user activities (running, walking, etc.) and infers the current
                                        amount of calories burned so far. When the user asks for a workout plan, <em>DLVfit</em>                                        proposes a set of exercises that would allow the user to reach her daily goal, taking
                                        into account also to her preferences. The suggested workout plans are computed in
                                        the background by DLV via EmbASP. </p>

                                    <p>The ASP program used within <em>DLVfit</em> can be found in the repository. Basically,
                                        the program guesses for possible fitness exercises to do in order to burn the remaing
                                        calories. Each answer set represent a possible workout plan, in which is ensured
                                        that the user's requirements about the calories to burn and the time to spend in
                                        the workout are respected. Moreover, also user's preferences are taken into account
                                        by means of weak constraints.</p>

                                        by proposing a series of educational games, and developing a personalized educational
                                        path. The games are divided into four macro-areas: Logic, Numeric-Mathematical, Memory,
                                        and Verbal Language. The usage of ASP allows the application to adapt to the game
                                        experiences fulfilled by the user, her formative gap, and the obtained improvements.

                                        The application continuously profiles the user by recording mistakes and successes, and dynamically builds and updates a
                                        customized educational path along the different games. The application features a
                                        "Parent Area", that allows parents to monitor child's achievements and to express
                                        some preferences, such as explicit filters of some games or educational areas.

                                        that allows a user to play the popular Connect Four game (also known as Four-in-a-Row)
                                        against an ASP-based artificial player.<br /> The Connect Four game is played by
                                        two opponents on a vertical 7*6 rectangular board. At each turn, the players fill
                                        the board by dropping 1 disk into one of the column so that it falls from the top
                                        to the lowest unoccupied position in the column. The winner is the first player who
                                        gets four of her disks in a line, connected either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.

                                        Different AIs have been implemented, ranging from the most powerful one implementing advanced techniques for the perfect
                                        play to the simplest one relying on some classical heuristic strategies. By using
                                        EmbASP, two different versions of the same app have been built: one for Android,
                                        making use of <a href="http://www.dlvsystem.com">DLV</a>, and one for Java-enabled desktop platforms, making use of <a href="http://potassco.sourceforge.net">clingo</a>.
